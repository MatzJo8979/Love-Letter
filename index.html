Six months. It feels like a blink, yet it’s been long enough to know that my life is better with you in it.

You are my joy, my calm after a storm, and the brightest part of my day. Thank you for being my partner, my confidant, and my greatest blessing. Every laugh we’ve shared, every quiet moment, every time you’ve been there for me, I treasure it all.

I’m so grateful for the love we’ve built and for the moments that are yet to come. You make me believe in forever, and I’m excited to walk toward it with you.

Here’s to us, to our story, and to the countless memories we’ll create.
